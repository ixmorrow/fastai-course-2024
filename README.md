# fastai-course-2024

I am currently taking the Fast.ai course "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" and following along in the book as well.

Course: https://course.fast.ai/
Book: https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html

I am creating this repository as a one stop shop for all things related to this course. It surprisingly has a ton of content and it's hard for me to keep track of it all. In addition, I am taking notes as I go along and writing blog posts trying to explain what I learn so I wanted one central place to store all of this information. Hopeufully this repo will be useful to others when they take this course in the future!

The recordings of the course available now are from 2022 and I am currently taking this in 2024, so it's two years delayed but the information is still good.

Please enjoy!
